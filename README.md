# Nextflow Pipeline with Conda

We are attempting sequential and parallel processing with Nextflow. We will take two small paired-end test FASTQ files and run them through fastp for QC control. Then we will take those outputs and run them
in parallel through spades and seqkit!

## üíª System & Software Requirements
- **Nextflow version**: 24.10.5 build 5935
- **Package manager**: Conda (Miniconda3)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **Device**: HP Spectre laptop with 2 CPU cores

## üß¨ Workflow Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Runs `fastp` on raw FASTQ data (quality filtering)
2. Uses `fastp` output to:
   - Run `spades` for de novo assembly
   - Run `seqkit` for basic read statistics  
   *(spades and seqkit run in parallel)*

## üì¶ Test Data

This repo includes two small paired-end test FASTQ files derived from the SRA run [SRR15268468](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR15268468) (*Listeria monocytogenes*).

They are located in the `data/` folder:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) and [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and create Nextflow environment:

```bash
conda create -n nf -c bioconda nextflow -y
conda activate nf
nextflow -version
```

Now clone directory to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.gatech.edu/nkodgi3/Nextflow.git
cd Nextflow/my_pipeline
nextflow run main.nf -profile test 
```
This runs it on debug mode so you can see if an errors occur!

##  üõ† Having Problems? Here Are More Debugging Tips!

First of all make sure you have the right repo structure from the download.

If not that's not the problem, here are some Nextflow commands that help with debugging:

```bash
nextflow log # See history of pipeline runs
nextflow run main.nf -profile test -resume # Skip recomputing successful steps
nextflow validate main.nf -profile test # Check pipeline syntax
nextflow run main.nf -profile test -with-trace # Record timing/resource usage in trace.txt
```
